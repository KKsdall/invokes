# Expetiments and Applications with VFO and BFO controlled by Arduino

This folder contains some tests, experimentations and applications with the VFO and BFO based on si5351 controlled by Arduino.

- The [Atmega328](https://github.com/pu2clr/VFO_BFO_OLED_ARDUINO/tree/master/Experiments/Atmega328) folder has a version of he VFO and BFO based on si5351 controlled by Arduino based on Atmega328 (UNO, Mini, NAO etc);
 - The [IRCOntrolle](https://github.com/pu2clr/VFO_BFO_OLED_ARDUINO/tree/master/Experiments/IRController) folder has a version of the VFO and BFO working with IR remote control;
 - The [VFO_RADIO_CD2003GP](https://github.com/pu2clr/VFO_BFO_OLED_ARDUINO/tree/master/Experiments/VFO_RADIO_CD2003GP) folder has an application of the VFO and BFO project with a inexpencive radio based on CD2003GP chip. A $6 comercial radio was modified to be tuned by the VFO with si5351 controlled by Arduino.
