I studied for four years Electrical Engineering at the University of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, but I ended up majoring in IT area at UPIS, Brasília, Brazil. From 1985 to 1998, I worked as a Developer using C/C++, FORTRAN and ALGOL Programming Languages at Federal University of Ceara (Universidade Federal do Ceará). From 1998 to 2010 I worked as a database administrator in several companies. Currently working as an independent consultant in the field of Information Technology. In 2007 I got post-graduate degree in Distributed Systems at University of Brasilia (UNB); In 2009 I wrote the book "Joomla!
